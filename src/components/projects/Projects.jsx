      <p>
        <strong>Wonderlust</strong> is a feature-rich Airbnb-like web application built using the MERN stack. Users can add their own listings, explore available stays, apply filters, view map locations, and post reviews.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app uses <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> for scalable cloud-based database storage and <strong>Cloudinary</strong> for image management. Each listing integrates <strong>Google Maps</strong> for geolocation, and user authentication is handled via <strong>Passport.js</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The frontend is developed with <strong>EJS templates</strong> for dynamic UI rendering. Backend APIs are managed using <strong>Express.js</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>. Deployed live using <strong>Render</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features include user authorization, review system, booking connectivity, and responsive UIâ€”making it a complete demonstration of practical MERN stack application.

        <p>
          Developed a sophisticated PDF-based AI assistant that enables users to upload documents and interact with them conversationally, providing instant access to document content through natural language queries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user interface, combined with FastAPI for robust backend processing. Utilized LangChain for sophisticated prompt orchestration and OpenAI models for natural language responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Integrated FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient document embedding and semantic retrieval, enabling fast and accurate search across large document collections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implemented a conversational chat interface that allows users to ask questions directly from uploaded PDFs, with the system providing contextually relevant answers based on document content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system supports multiple document formats and provides real-time processing, making it ideal for research, document analysis, and knowledge extraction from large text corpora.
