              Hey! I&apos;m Shahzad, I&apos;m an AI Full Stack Engineer with a passion for building intelligent applications and AI-powered solutions. I specialize in integrating cutting-edge AI technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs), RAG-based systems, and custom AI pipelines into full-stack applications.

              My expertise spans the entire AI development stack - from budilding AI agents using LLMs  to building robust RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems that provide contextually relevant responses. I enjoy crafting intelligent applications that leverage AI to solve real-world problems, whether it's automating data pipelines, creating conversational AI assistants, or building document analysis systems.

            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              On the full-stack side, I work with modern technologies like MERN, FastAPI, Python, and various AI frameworks including LangChain, OpenAI SDK, and vector databases. I have experience building scalable architectures that seamlessly integrate AI capabilities with traditional web applications, ensuring both performance and user experience are optimized.
